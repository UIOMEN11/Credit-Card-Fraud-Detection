# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. The model is built using a Random Forest classifier, which is known for its high accuracy and robustness in handling large datasets with many features.

# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial industry, causing significant financial losses and affecting consumer trust. This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, transaction time, and various anonymized features derived from the original data.

# Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

# Handling missing values
Normalizing/Scaling features
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Balancing the dataset using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
Model
The Random Forest classifier is used for this project due to its ability to handle imbalanced datasets and provide high accuracy. Key steps in building the model include:

Initializing the Random Forest classifier
Training the model on the training data
Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search
Evaluation
The model is evaluated using various metrics including:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
